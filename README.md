# 🍈 melonBot

> melonBot is a Discord bot that can add/remove roles from message reactions.

## 📃 About
melonBot was originally made for a friend, but I see no reason why others can't benefit from this bot too.

## 🔐 Bot Permissions
The Discord bot requires certain global permissions in your server to be able to work properly:

- View Channels
- Manage Roles
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Add Reactions
- Manage Messages
- Read Message History

This bot also accepts Role ID's, @RoleMentions as well as Role names, [Role names can be an issue if you have 2 roles with the same name that you want to add, in that case I would use @RoleMention or Role ID]; To take full advantage of this feature of the bot, please enable `PRESENCE INTENT` and `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`. This will allow the bot to collect Cache for guild members.
